# default beside it: raising the pin here changed nothing in a build
# directory that already had one, silently, and the build went on using the
# revision from before the change. So the pin that was applied is
# remembered, and a pin that differs from it wins -- while -DCME_VERSION=
# on the command line still stands until this file says something else.
#
# Taken from the file uploaded to the release rather than from
# archive/<ref>.tar.gz: the generated one is made on request, and when the
# compression behind it changed every digest pinned against it broke at once.
# A file uploaded to a release is stored as it was uploaded.
